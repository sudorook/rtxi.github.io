Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which
motor neurons degenerate resulting in muscle atrophy, paralysis and fatality.
Studies using mouse models of ALS indicate a protracted period of disease
development with progressive motor neuron pathology, evident as early as
embryonic and postnatal stages. Key missing information includes concomitant
alterations in the sensorimotor circuit essential for normal development and
function of the neuromuscular system. Leveraging unique brainstem circuitry, we
show in vitro evidence for reflex circuit-specific postnatal abnormalities in
the jaw proprioceptive sensory neurons in the well-studied SOD1 G93A mouse.
These include impaired and arrhythmic action potential burst discharge
associated with a deficit in Nav1.6 Na + channels. However, the
mechanoreceptive and nociceptive trigeminal ganglion neurons and the visual
sensory retinal ganglion neurons were resistant to excitability changes in age
matched SOD1 G93A mice. Computational modeling of the observed disruption in
sensory patterns predicted asynchronous self-sustained motor neuron discharge
suggestive of imminent reflexive defects such as muscle fasciculations in ALS.
These results demonstrate a novel reflex circuit-specific proprioceptive
sensory abnormality in ALS.
