Kilohertz electrical stimulation (KES) has enabled a novel new paradigm for
spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation to treat a variety of neurological
diseases.  KES can excite or inhibit nerve activity and is used in many
clinical devices today. However, the impact of different electrode materials on
the efficacy of KES is unknown.  We investigated the effect of different
electrode materi- als and their respective charge injection mechanisms on KES
nerve block thresholds using 20- and 40-kHz current- controlled sinusoidal KES
waveforms. We evaluated the nerve block threshold and the power requirements
for achieving an effective KES nerve block. In addition, we evaluated potential
effects on the onset duration and recovery of normal conduction after delivery
of KES. We found that thresholds and the onset and recovery of KES nerve block
are not a function of the electrode material. In contrast, the power
dissipation varies among electrode materials and is a function of the
materials’ properties at high frequencies.  We conclude that materials with a
proven track record of chronic stability, both for the tissue and electrode,
are suitable for developing KES nerve block therapies.
