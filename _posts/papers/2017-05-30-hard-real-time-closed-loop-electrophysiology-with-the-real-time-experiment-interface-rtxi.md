The ability to experimentally perturb biological systems has traditionally been
limited to static pre-programmed or operator-controlled protocols. In contrast,
real-time control allows dynamic probing of biological systems with
perturbations that are computed on-the-fly dur- ing experimentation. Real-time
control applications for biological research are available; however, these
systems are costly and often restrict the flexibility and customization of
experimental protocols. The Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI) is an open
source soft- ware platform for achieving hard real-time data acquisition and
closed-loop control in biologi- cal experiments while retaining the flexibility
needed for experimental settings. RTXI has enabled users to implement complex
custom closed-loop protocols in single cell, cell net- work, animal, and human
electrophysiology studies. RTXI is also used as a free and open source,
customizable electrophysiology platform in open-loop studies requiring online
data acquisition, processing, and visualization. RTXI is easy to install, can
be used with an exten- sive range of external experimentation and data
acquisition hardware, and includes stan- dard modules for implementing common
electrophysiology protocols.
