Neurons utilize bursts of action potentials as an efficient and reliable way to
encode information. It is likely that the intrinsic membrane properties of
neurons involved in burst generation may also participate in preserving its
temporal features. Here we examined the contribution of the persistent and
resurgent components of voltage-gated Na+ currents in modulating the burst
discharge in sensory neurons. Using mathematical modeling, theory and dynamic-
clamp electrophysiology, we show that, distinct from the persistent Na+
component which is important for membrane resonance and burst generation, the
resurgent Na+ can help stabilize burst timing features including the duration
and intervals. Moreover, such a physiological role for the resurgent Na+
offered noise tolerance and preserved the regularity of burst pat- terns.
Model analysis further predicted a negative feedback loop between the
persistent and resurgent gating variables which mediate such gain in burst
stability. These results highlight a novel role for the voltage-gated resurgent
Na+ component in moderating the entropy of burst-encoded neural information.
