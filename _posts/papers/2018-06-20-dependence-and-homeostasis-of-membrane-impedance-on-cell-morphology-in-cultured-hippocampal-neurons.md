The electrical impedance of cell membranes is important for excitable cells,
such as neurons, because it strongly influences the amount of membrane
potential change upon a flow of ionic current across the membrane. Here, we
report on an investigation of how neuronal morphology affects membrane
impedance of cultured hippocampal neurons. Microfabricated substrates with
patterned scaffolding molecules were used to restrict the neurite growth of
hippocampal neurons, and the impedance was measured via whole-cell patch-clamp
recording under the inhibition of voltage-dependent ion channels.  Membrane
impedance was found to depend inversely on the dendrite length and soma area,
as would be expected from the fact that its electrical property is equivalent
to a parallel RC circuit. Moreover, we found that in biological neurons, the
membrane impedance is homeostatically regulated to impede changes in the
membrane area. The findings provide direct evidence on cell-autonomous
regulation of neuronal impedance and pave the way towards elucidating the
mechanism responsible for the resilience of biological neuronal networks.
