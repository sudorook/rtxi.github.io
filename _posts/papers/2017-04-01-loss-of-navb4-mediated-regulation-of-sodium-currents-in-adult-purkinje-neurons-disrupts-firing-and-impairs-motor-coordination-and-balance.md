The resurgent component of voltage-gated Na + (Nav) currents, I NaR , has been
suggested to provide the de- polarizing drive for high-frequency firing and to
be generated by voltage-dependent Nav channel block (at depolarized potentials)
and unblock (at hyperpo- larized potentials) by the accessory Navb4 subunit.
To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of the targeted deletion of
Scn4b (Navb4) on I NaR and on repetitive firing in cerebellar Purkinje neurons.
We show here that Scn4b / animals have deficits in motor coordination and
balance and that firing rates in Scn4b / Purkinje neurons are markedly attenu-
ated. Acute, in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-medi- ated ‘‘knockdown’’ of
Navb4 in adult Purkinje neu- rons also reduced spontaneous and evoked firing
rates. Dynamic clamp-mediated addition of I NaR partially rescued firing in
Scn4b / Purkinje neurons.  Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that I NaR was
reduced (by 50%), but not eliminated, in Scn4b / Purkinje neurons, revealing
that additional mecha- nisms contribute to generation of I NaR .
