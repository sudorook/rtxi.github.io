We have previously introduced a model for closed- loop respiratory control
incorporating an explicit conductance- based model of bursting pacemaker cells
driven by hypoxia sensitive chemosensory feedback. Numerical solution of the
model equations revealed two qualitatively distinct asymptot- ically stable
dynamical behaviors: one analogous to regular breathing (eupnea), and a second
analogous to pathologically rapid, shallow breathing (tachypnea). As an
experimental test of this model, we created a hybrid in vitro/in silico
circuit. We used Real Time eXperimental Interface (RTXI) dynamic clamp to
incorporate a living pacemaker cell recorded in vitro into a numerical
simulation of the closed-loop control model in real time. Here we show that the
hybrid circuit can sustain the same bistable behavior as the purely
computational model, and we assess the ability of the hybrid circuit to recover
from simulated bouts of transient hypoxia.
