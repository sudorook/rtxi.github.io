Dynamic clamp, a hybrid-computational-experimental technique that has been used
to elucidate ionic mechanisms underlying cardiac electrophysiology, is emerging
as a promising tool in the discovery of potential anti-arrhythmic targets and
in pharmacological safety testing. Through the injection of computationally
simulated conductances into isolated cardiomyocytes in a real-time continuous
loop, dynamic clamp has greatly expanded the capabilities of patch clamp
outside traditional static voltage and current protocols. Recent applications
include fine manipulation of injected artificial conductances to identify
promising drug targets in the prevention of arrhythmia and the direct testing
of model-based hypotheses. Furthermore, dynamic clamp has been used to enhance
existing experimental models by addressing their intrinsic limitations, which
increased predictive power in identifying pro-arrhythmic pharmacological
compounds.  Here, we review the recent advances of the dynamic clamp technique
in cardiac electrophysiology with a focus on its future role in the development
of safety testing and discovery of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
