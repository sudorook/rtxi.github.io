Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be used to generate scalable numbers of
cardiomyocytes (CMs) for studying cardiac biology, disease modelling, drug
screens, and potentially for regenerative therapies. A fluorescence-based
reporter line will significantly enhance our capacities to visualize the
derivation, survival, and function of hESC-derived CMs. Our goal was to develop
a reporter cell line for real-time monitoring of live hESC-derived CMs.
Methods and results 

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock a mCherry reporter gene into the MYH6 locus of
hESC lines, H1 and H9, enabling real-time monitoring of the generation of CMs.
MYH6:mCherry+ cells express atrial or ventricular markers and display a range
of cardiomyocyte action potential morphologies. At 20 days of differentiation,
MYH6:mCherry+ cells show features characteristic of human CMs and can be used
successfully to monitor drug-induced cardiotoxicity and oleic acid-induced
cardiac arrhythmia.

We created two MYH6:mCherry hESC reporter lines and documented the application
of these lines for disease modelling relevant to cardiomyocyte biology.
